# Basics_C-
## Aim
We learn about basics of C++.
## Theory
C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s as an extension of C. It combines the efficiency and control of C with object-oriented programming features, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from system software and game development to complex business applications.

**Syntax:** C++ syntax is similar to C, with a focus on type safety and structure. A typical C++ program consists of functions, including the `main()` function, which is the entry point of every C++ program.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** A key feature of C++ is its support for OOP, which includes concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. This allows for modeling complex systems and promoting code reuse.

**Memory Management:** C++ provides both static and dynamic memory management. Static memory is allocated at compile time, while dynamic memory can be allocated at runtime using operators like `new` and `delete`.

**Standard Template Library (STL):** C++ also includes the Standard Template Library, a powerful set of template classes that provide general-purpose classes and functions like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks. These components make it easier to implement common data structures and algorithms.

**Exception Handling:** C++ supports robust exception handling, allowing developers to manage errors and unexpected situations gracefully using `try`, `catch`, and `throw` constructs.

C++ remains one of the most versatile languages, offering a blend of procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms. Its efficiency, coupled with the ability to directly manipulate hardware resources and extensive library support, makes it an enduring choice for developers across various domains.
